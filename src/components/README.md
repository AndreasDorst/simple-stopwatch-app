### Implement a stopwatch.

An application should have a button, which adds a new stopwatch to the list. 

Every stopwatch should have a “start” button. When it is clicked, it disappears, and buttons “pause” and “clear” are shown.
If a stopwatch is paused, the button “pause” is replaced with “resume”.
On “clear” click counter is stopped and cleared, button start should appear. 

Also you should be able to delete a stopwatch.

It will be enough if stopwatches iterate once in a second, but you can implement your own approach.
You can use icons instead of text.
